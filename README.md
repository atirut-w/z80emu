# Z80Emu
> **Warning**: very early WIP. Barely functional. Deal with T-States yourself(dw, the emu returns the amount of t-states consumed by an instruction).

C++ Z80 emulator library because [Java is a pain in the ass for writing an emu](https://github.com/atirut-w/ocz80/blob/main/src/main/java/com/github/atirut/ocz80/state/Run.java).
